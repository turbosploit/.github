# TurboSploit

This repository hosts another post exploitation framework, created by humans for humans.

The main goal is to create a framework in its most abstract form, able to be used by red-teamers to develop their own tools.

The programming languages adopted in this organization are essentially C and C++, obviously using Assembly, targetting everything where the code can run.

Don't be afraid to handle the memory.
